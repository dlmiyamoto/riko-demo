<p>
This unique class is designed for new moms and moms-to-be (and of course dads, too!). During one-on-one instruction, parents learn the basics of harmony and melody at the keyboard and discover innovative ways of using the piano as a bonding tool between mother and child.

Through singing and playing at the piano, moms will learn to accompany lullabies and gain valuable skills for transferring a love and appreciation of music to newborns and infants. Be your childâ€™s first musical idol!
