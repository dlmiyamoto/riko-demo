            <h2>Our Method</h2>
            <p>Based on Riko's 30-plus years of experience as a music educator, the Riko Method is a complete first-year piano course and educational philosophy. From the very first lesson, RMSP students learn to approach music critically: analyzing musical
                material, organizing it intelligently, and executing it with precision. Thanks to this efficient approach, complex music is easily digestible by even the youngest first-year students. The Riko Method is also a comprehensive curriculum.
                At every lesson, students work on technique, ear-training, music theory and sight-reading. The genius of the Riko Method is how it combines all of these elements in a playful, interactive and engaging lesson style that students love</p>

                "For Los Angeles to remain this country's capital of creative expression and cultural substance, we must create an opportunity for the next generation of Angelenos to fall in love with art. Art is not a luxury, it's a necessity--especially in Los Angeles.
                It fuels our economy; it helps us think creatively; and, most importantly, it makes us happy. As a pianist myself, I am grateful that Riko Method School of Piano recognizes the importance of supporting the pursuit of music and I can't
                wait tocatch a concert at the new Scarlatti Concert Hall."
