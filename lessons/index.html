Private lessons at Riko Method School of Piano are taught on a weekly basis (45-minutes per lesson). Lessons are individually tailored based on age, experience level and musical affinities. Each private student is paired with a teacher who specializes in the student’s area of interest (jazz, classical, pop, etc.).

While lessons are unique to each student, all lessons are driven by the consistent foundations of the Riko Method, and all students receive classical and pop training. The Riko Method is designed specifically to increase the positive effects of music study on the brain. Beginner students learn the fundamentals of music study using the Riko Method toolkit –– a piano book with original compositions and a workbook with activities that teach the basics of music theory. Specially designed games using Riko Method playing cards accelerate sight-reading skills, and ear-training is an integral part of each lesson.

All Riko Method instructors are carefully selected, vetted and extensively trained in the Riko Method, ensuring consistency and quality across the board. We are proud of our passionate, personable instructors who connect with their students, communicate clearly, and work closely with students to help them achieve their musical goals.

Riko Method instructors are certified members of the Music Teachers’ Association of California (MTAC). Many of our private students participate in MTAC’s annual Certificate of Merit program. All of our students perform in our annual school recital each spring.
